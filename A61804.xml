            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE OF THE <hi>Pope's Supremacy.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THOUGH the Pope's univerſal Paſtorſhip is a Claim ſo groundleſs, and the Vanity of it hath been ſo expoſed, not only by Proteſtants, but by ſome learned Men of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he had need have a <hi>Roman</hi> Confidence, who ſhall now think to impoſe upon us, by a pretence ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly baffled; yet becauſe it is by many ſtill inſiſted upon with as much Aſſurance, as if nothing had been ſaid in Confutation of it, it may not be amiſs to enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any thing <hi>new</hi> hath been produc'd in defence of this <hi>good old Cauſe</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by her late Advocates <note n="*" place="margin">Nubes Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. <hi>St.</hi> Peter<hi>'s Supremacy faithfully diſcuſs'd, according to holy Scripture, and Greek and Latin Fathers. A Sermon of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>preached before her Majeſty the Queen</hi> Dowager, <hi>by</hi> Thomas Godden, <hi>D. D. The Pope's Supremacy aſſerted from the Conſiderations of ſome Proteſtants, and the Practice of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church; in a Dialogue between a Church-Divine and a Seeker, in Vidication of</hi> Nubes Teſtium.</note>.</p>
            <p>The firſt of thoſe Diſcourſes quoted in the Margin, hath already received an Anſwer; and I think it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to repeat what hath been ſaid by the learned Author of it. The other three I intend to examine; the two
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100327:3"/> former of them joyntly, becauſe there is no Argument offer'd in the Sermon, that we do not alſo meet with in the Treaties of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Supremacy;</hi> the third (which is a Reply to the Anſwer to the <hi>Nubes Teſtium)</hi> ſhall be conſider'd diſtinctly and apart.</p>
            <p>The Diſcourſe of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Supremacy</hi> was written (as the Author informs us) in Confutation of ſome <note place="margin">Advertiſement to the Reader.</note> Papers he received from a <hi>Proteſtant Divine:</hi> having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen thoſe Papers, and having great reaſon upon many accounts to ſuſpect that what he quotes from them is not fairly repreſented, I ſhall take no notice of them; but whatſoever I find in his Book that is pertinent to the main Queſtion, and hath but the ſhew of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall be duly conſider'd. What he hath offer'd, <hi>is</hi> (he tells us) <hi>as well perform'd as his Abilities would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;</hi> and his Abilities, we may preſume, were none of the meaneſt, after he had <hi>given the Fathers a due Diſcuſſion,</hi> and <hi>applied himſelf to the modern Authors of both ſides;</hi> that he himſelf had no low opinion of his Performance, we may reaſonably conclude, in that he thought it worthy the Approbation and Protection of <hi>her Majeſty the Queen Regent;</hi> I therefore expected great matters, beyond what I had formerly met with; but no ſooner had I read a few pages, but my Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion flagg'd, and upon the Peruſal of the whole Book, I ſcarce ever found my ſelf more diſappointed.</p>
            <p>The firſt Part is wholly ſpent upon other Points (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting part of chap. 1. concerning St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor) <hi>it being,</hi> as he himſelf tells us, <hi>but Prefatory, and introductive to the main Deſign he aim'd at,</hi> which <note place="margin">Part. 2. chap. 1.</note> in the ſecond Part he applies himſelf to, and his whole Diſcourſe in the ſecond and third Parts, may be reduc'd to theſe two general Heads.</p>

                  </hi> he attempts to prove by ſeveral Texts of Holy Scripture, and by the Teſtimonies of ſeveral Fathers, which he quotes as he goes along, to confirm the Senſe he gives of thoſe Scriptures.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures he produces, he was put to no pains to ſearch for, they being no other than thoſe common Texts, which have, I think, been preſſed upon the ſame Service, by every Romaniſt that hath ever writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon this Subject, <hi>viz. Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18, 19. <hi>John.</hi> 21. 16. In the firſt he ſuppoſes that Chriſt promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this <hi>Supremacy;</hi> in the ſecond, that he conferr'd it.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. I.</head>
                  <p>I begin with the firſt, whence he argues, as his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors in this Controverſy have ever done, from the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100327:4"/> double Promiſe Chriſt made to St. <hi>Peter:</hi> The one in theſe Words, <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock will I build my Church:</hi> the other in theſe, <hi>And I will give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. But before he proceeds to diſcourſe of theſe, there are two things he ſuppoſes as the reaſon and Foundation of this ſpecial Honour conferr'd on St. <hi>Peter</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Part 2. c. 1, 2, 3.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That at the time when he made this Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he alone knew the Divinity of Chriſt; the reſt of the Apoſtles being as yet ignorant of this great Myſtery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he knew this by a ſpecial Revelation from God the Father.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore firſt, examine his Foundation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if that fail, the <hi>Supremacy</hi> built thereon, will of it ſelf fall to the Ground.</p>
                  <p>It hath not without Reaſon been queſtioned by ſome, whether by <hi>the Son of the living God,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> meant any more than he did by <hi>the Christ;</hi> not only becauſe the former Expreſſion is in other Texts of Scripture expounded by the latter, but becauſe St. <hi>Mark,</hi> ſpeaking of this very Confeſſion of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> makes it no more than this, <hi>Thou art the Chriſt</hi> 
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">Mark 8. 29.</note>: And St. <hi>Luke,</hi> that he was <hi>the Chriſt of God</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Luke 9. 20.</note>: Yea, the Diſcuſſor himſelf ſuppoſes, that <hi>Peter</hi> confeſſed no more than what Chriſt afterward <hi>ſtrictly commanded his Diſciples to conceal, as too ſublime to be divulged</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 79.</note>: And that we find <hi>ver.</hi> 20. was no more than this, <hi>That he was Jeſus the Chriſt.</hi> And if St. <hi>Peter's</hi> Confeſſion amounted to no more, it cannot then be denied, but that St. <hi>Andrew</hi> long before him confeſſed as much, when he ſaid, <hi>We have found the Meſſiah</hi> 
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">John 1. 49.</note>: And that <hi>Nathanael</hi>'s Confeſſion was no

                  <p>But be it granted, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> by the <hi>Son of the living God,</hi> meant that he was the Son of <hi>God</hi> by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (as the Fathers generally expound it) yet that the other Apoſtles were not at this time ignorant of this Myſtery, but knew it as well as St. <hi>Peter,</hi> will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently cleared,</p>

                     <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 92, 93.</note> I need not make Reflections upon all theſe: It will be ſufficient to ſhew, that if <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> and the <hi>Devils</hi> knew it, the Apoſtles could not be ignorant of it. And,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That it follows from the Knowledg of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> and that ſeveral ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe St. <hi>John</hi> could not but think himſelf in Duty bound, to impart this Knowledg to his Country-Men. His Office was to bear Witneſs of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and what more worthy to be witneſſed concerning him, than the Divine Excellency of his Perſon? He was by his Teſtimony to prepare the way, to diſpoſe Men to believe on him; could he then without Unfaithfulneſs omit that which above all other Arguments would be of Power to work Faith in them? He who was ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to confirm his Diſciples in the Belief, that he was the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Matth. 11. 2, 3.</note>; can it be ſuppoſed, that he would not acquaint them with that, which would above all other things, render them ſtedfaſt in this Belief? And if he publiſh'd this in his popular Diſcourſes, who can imagin that it never came to the Ears of the Apoſtles?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſame is clearly inferred from the means, by which the Diſcuſſor ſuppoſes <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> arriv'd at this Knowledg, <hi>viz.</hi> the Voice from Heaven, at Jeſus's
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100327:6"/> Baptiſm. <hi>He who heard a noiſe from Heaven, by a Celeſtial Herald promulging him to be the Son of God: He who ſaw the holy Ghoſt effigiated in the Form of a Dove</hi> (that may be queſtion'd) <hi>deſcending from above, and lighting upon him, may very well be imagined to be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who he was</hi> 
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">Pag. 92.</note>: If ſo, may it not as well be imagin'd, that the Apoſtles might be as well inſtructed, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this Noiſe from Heaven, they received from <hi>John?</hi> May not a Man underſtand as much by hearing a thing at ſecond hand, (and as firmly believe it too, if he hear it from a Perſon of unqueſtionable Credit) as if he heard it at the firſt? And that <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> bear record of this, St. <hi>John the Evangeliſt</hi> hath told us <note n="*" place="margin">John 1. 32.</note>: And can any conſidering Man perſwade himſelf, that the Apoſtles of our Saviour ſhould be ignorant of that, which the Baptiſt openly proclaimed to all the Jews?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. St. <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> gave yet more pregnant proofs to his Hearers of Chriſt's Divinity. He bear record, that he was <hi>The Son of God,</hi> by way of eminency, ſo as never any other Man was, (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle) if this be not thought enough, he loudly teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he had a real being, before he was a Man. For John <hi>cried, this was he of whom I ſpake, HE THAT COMETH AFTER ME IS PREFERRED BEFORE ME, FOR HE WAS BEFORE ME</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">John 1. 34.</note>: In which Words (as a learned Biſhop of this Church hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) <q>firſt, <hi>John</hi> taketh to himſelf a Priority of time, ſpeaking of <hi>Chriſt, He that cometh after me.</hi> For ſo he came after him into the Womb at his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, into the World at his Nativity, <hi>&amp;c. 2dly,</hi> He attributeth to Chriſt a Priority of Dignity, ſaying, <hi>He is perferred before me.—3dly,</hi> He rendereth the reaſon or cauſe of the great Dignity that belong'd to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100327:6"/> 
                        <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaying <hi>for,</hi> or rather <hi>becauſe he was before me.</hi> As if the Baptiſt had thus ſpake at large: This <note place="margin">Pearſon <hi>on the ſecond Article of the Creed.</hi> p. 218, 219. <hi>of the firſt Edit.</hi>
                        </note> Man Chriſt Jeſus who came in to the World, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon his Prophetical Office ſix Months after me, is notwithſtanding of far more Worth and greater Dignity; even ſo much greater, that I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg my ſelf unworthy to ſtoop down, and unlooſe the Latchet of his Shoes: And the Reaſon of this tranſcendent Dignity, is from the Excellency of that Nature, which he had before I was; for though he cometh after me, yet he was before me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, St. <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> prefers <hi>Christ</hi> before him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this, that whereas he himſelf had his Original from the Earth, <hi>Christ</hi> came from Heaven, and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all <note n="*" place="margin">John 3. 31.</note>; thereby ſignifying that Divine Nature by which he exiſted in Heaven, before he was conceived in his humane Nature of the bleſſed Virgin. Can it then be in reaſon ſuppoſed, that the Apoſtles knew not this Myſtery, which <hi>John</hi> ſo freely publiſh'd to his Hearers? eſpecially conſidering, that ſome of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were the Diſciples of <hi>John,</hi> before they were the Diſciples of Chriſt. But,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> knew the Divinity of Chriſt, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> we may conclude knew it much rather; ſince beſides what they had heard from <hi>John</hi> concerning it, they had learn'd much more from their Maſter himſelf by his private Inſtructions, and his publick Preaching. Among other things they could not but have obſerved, that he had frequently diſcovered Mens ſecret Thoughts and Reaſonings; that he had affirmed himſelf to be <hi>Lord of the Sabbath,</hi> and that he had <hi>power on Earth to forgive Sins.</hi> They had no doubt heard him ſay, that God was his <hi>own</hi> Father, and knew that the Jews accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him of Blaſphemy for ſaying ſo, becauſe thereby
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100327:7"/> they concluded he made himſelf equal with God. Theſe and many other matters of the like import they had heard from his own Mouth, of the Truth of which they were abundantly ſatisfied, by ſeeing him do ſuch Miracles, which no Man before ever did, in confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what he ſaid. The Argument then lies thus; If <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> knew Chriſt to be <hi>the Son of the Living God,</hi> the Apoſtles of Chriſt much more knew him to be ſo, becauſe they had not only all the ſame Arguments that he had, but many more from the Words and Actions of Chriſt himſelf to aſſure them of this great Truth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſame Concluſion is as ſtrongly infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from what the Diſcuſſor grants of the Devil's Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and the ways by which he attained to it. <hi>How the Devils arrived to this Knowledg, Opinions,</hi> he ſays, <hi>are various:</hi> Three of which he mentions.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſeems to be of no weight, <hi>viz. That when he was a glorious Angel in Heaven, God revealed to him that his Son ſhould aſſume humane Nature, and that Man ſhould be exalted to the hypoſtatic <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with the Word</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 93.</note>. That God revealed this to him, when he was a glorious Angel, there is not the leaſt proof; and in caſe he did, yet unleſs he reveal'd alſo, that this <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was the Man that was exalted to the Hypoſtatic Union with the Word, it will not reach the Point to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. And he muſt be a Man of a wonderful fancy who can imagine that this was revealed to the Devil, when he was a glorious Angel in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>As for the other ways he mentions, the Devil had by them no advantage of the Apoſtles. For the next opinion he cites, is that of <hi>Theophylact, viz.</hi> that <hi>the Thief ſtole this Knowledg from the Voice from Heaven.</hi> And why might not the Apoſtles alſo get it the ſame way? For though they heard not this Voice immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100327:7"/> from Heaven, yet they had the report of it from <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and as firmly believ'd it, as if they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had at firſt heard it.</p>
                  <p>The third opinion is that of St. <hi>Auſtin, viz.</hi> That it was made known to the Devil <hi>by the operation of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miracles wrought by the Finger of God, which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil knew did tranſcend his, and all Angelical Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in this the Apoſtles who were Chriſt's conſtant Attendants, and the Eye-witneſſes of his Miracles, were not inferiour; but if there was any difference, it may be preſum'd the Advantage lay on the Apoſtles ſide. For tho they knew not how far the Power of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Spirits might reach, and whether ſome of his Works were ſuch as exceeded their Power to effect: yet there were others of them, (and they the far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part) that could leave no ground for any ſuch Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, but were ſuch unqueſtionable Effects of a Divine Power, that all Mankind have concluded, they could be wrought by none but the Finger of God.</p>
                  <p>If then by theſe means the Devil came to know the Divinity of Chriſt, might not all the Apoſtes as well know it, having the ſame means of knowing it? Let us now ſee what was the Judgment of the Ancients in this point.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The ſame Concluſion is alſo confirm'd by the Teſtimonies of many more Fathers, than are alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Diſcuſſor for the contrary. He produces three, <hi>viz. Hilary, Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> of <hi>Seleucia.</hi> Let theſe be yielded to him, what will they ſignify, when they are over-voted by a far greater Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber?</p>
                  <p>The Diſcuſſor himſelf grants, that <hi>the Fathers inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſay, that the other Apoſtles knew Chriſt to be the</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100327:8"/> 
                     <hi>Son of God, before St</hi> Peter's <hi>promulging him ſo:</hi> But then he ſays, <hi>they meant thereby his nominal, not his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Filiation.</hi> Let us therefore ſee whether he truly repreſents their meaning. He inſtances only in St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> whom <hi>he finds in one place to affirm, that the other Apoſtles knew Chriſt to be the Son of God as well as St.</hi> Peter; <hi>and in another to ſeem to appropriate it wholly to him</hi> 
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">Pag. 90.</note>. In the one then he roundly affirms, that the other Apoſtles knew it; in the other he does but ſeem to deny it. The place, he means, in which he affirms it, is, I preſume, in the ſixth Book of his Comments on St. <hi>Luke, c.</hi> 9. Now the Queſtion is, whether St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> in this place meant, that the Apoſtles knew the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of Chriſt, which no Man that impartially reads the Text, can ſo much as queſtion (and therefore it was wiſely done of the Diſcuſſor, not to tell his Reader where it was to be found) for St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting upon St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Anſwer, as it is recorded by St. <hi>Luke, Thou art the Chriſt of God,</hi> ſays thus; <hi>If it was ſufficient to the Apoſtle</hi> Paul, <hi>to know nothing but Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and him crucified; what more ſhould I deſire to know than Chriſt? for in this one Name, is the Expreſſion both of his Divinity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, and the Faith of his Paſſion. And therefore THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GH THE OTHER APOSTLES KNEW IT, yet</hi> Peter <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers rather than the reſt, THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> ART CHRIST THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD; he therefore compriſed all, who expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed both his Nature and his Name</hi>

                  <p> But <hi>this Opinion,</hi> ſaith the Diſcuſſor, reflecting upon Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cave, ſeemed to me very thin and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> The reaſon why it ſeemed ſo to him, follows, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Chriſt ſhould propound a Queſtion to a dozen Perſons, which he knew any of them could ſolve, and make honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Promiſes only to him that ſhould ſpeak firſt, ſeem'd to me,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a childiſh Fancy, and beneath the Conceptions of a Doctor.</hi>

                  <p>He here forgot his good Friend <hi>Maldonate,</hi> who was of the ſame <hi>ſilly Opinion.</hi> But is it indeed <hi>ſilly</hi> to think, that Chriſt ſhould propound a Queſtion to a dozen, which he knew any one of them could anſwer? That Queſtion which juſt before this he propounded to the ſame dozen, <hi>(Whom do Men ſay, that I the Son of Man am?)</hi> did he not know, that every one of them could anſwer it? and ſo indeed they all did, or at leaſt ſo many of them as pleaſed: That other Queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by Chriſt to all the twelve ſometime before this, <hi>(Will ye alſo go back?)</hi> did he not know, that every one of them could anſwer it, ſo far as it concern'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?

That is, he is ſaid by them to anſwer for them all, becauſe having a greater Faith, he firſt burſt out into that Confeſſion which they would have made, had not he got the ſtart of them.

                     <p>From this paſſage of <hi>Maldonat,</hi> I ſhall obſerve three things. 1.

That what <hi>Peter</hi> anſwer'd was the Faith of them all. The firſt of theſe he denies; the ſecond he grants. 2. The Queſtions propounded by <hi>Maldonat,</hi> to overthrow the firſt of theſe Propoſitions, the <hi>Diſcuſſor</hi> produces, as if he had deſigned them, for the Confutation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Propoſition; which is a notable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Sincerity. 3. Since <hi>Maldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat</hi> alſo thought, that Chriſt in theſe Words, <hi>

                  <p>The ſecond ground he lays of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Supremacy is, That he knew Chriſt's Divinity by a ſpecial Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. <hi>For tho</hi> Peter<hi>'s Confeſſion did exceed that of others, yet this,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was not the ſole reaſon of his Preferment and Honour; but becauſe the Father ſingled him out of the Apoſtolick Society, illuminating him with a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 80.</note> And again, <hi>The Father and the Holy Ghost cull him out of the whole Body of the Apoſtles, and honour him particularly with a Revelation</hi> 
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">Pag. 81.</note>. And again, <hi>I will never be induc'd to believe otherwiſe, than that St.</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<hi>'s Revelation did diſcover to him more than either what he or they knew before, otherwiſe it had been of no import</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 90.</note>. And ſo again and again, as if he thought he could make up what was wanting in proof, by the frequent and impertinent repetition of it.</p>
                  <p>I know not any that would <hi>induce him to believe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,</hi> than that God revealed this to St. <hi>Peter;</hi> that this Revelation diſcovered to him more than what he knew before; <hi>that all the forces of Man's Wit, all human Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Induſtry and Sagacity, could never have arrived to it, without a Revelation.</hi> Nothing of this is the matter in diſpute; but whether this Revelation was peculiar to <hi>Peter.</hi> And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I have already ſhewed, that it was not ſo, by proving that his fellow-Apoſtles knew the ſame thing, and by conſequence had the Revelation of it as well as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100327:14"/> he. And whereas he ſays, we may find the Fathers aſſert this, by the following Quotations. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I have carefully read over all thoſe Quotations, and cannot find, that ſo much as one of the Fathers quoted, aſſert it: They ſay indeed, that <hi>Peter</hi> had it by Divine Revelation, which is no more than our Saviour plainly tells us; But they do not ſay, that he only had this Revelation, or uſe any ſuch Words as exclude the other <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> I ſhall inſtance in two or three of his Quotations, that the Reader may ſee how pertinent they are. Peter <hi>was declared bleſſed, having ſpoken the things of God</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 80.</note>. Is not this much to the Purpoſe? Again, <hi>he pronounces</hi> Peter <hi>bleſſed, becauſe he received his Knowledg from the Divine Grace.</hi> And is not this every-whit as much? Once more; <hi>As the Prince of the Apoſtles wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, who was thought worthy to be proclaim'd bleſſed, becauſe the Father revealed it to him.</hi> But is it ſaid, the Father revealed it to none but him? The Diſcuſſor perhaps may ſay, this is imply'd, though not expreſſed. How ſo? becauſe they mention <hi>Peter only.</hi> The reaſon of that is, becauſe our Saviour directed his reply to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> only; and there was good reaſon why he ſhould do ſo, though he meant it to the whole Company, becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> alone had return'd the Anſwer to his Queſtion; but as he anſwer'd not for his ſingle ſelf, but for them all, ſo Chriſt's return to him, muſt be extended to all. For ſince they all knew it, (as has been prov'd) and ſince they could no other way attain to this Knowledg than by Revelation, it might therefore as truly be ſaid to <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John; Bleſſed art thou</hi> James, <hi>and bleſſed art thou</hi> John, <hi>for Fleſh and Blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This is no more than what <hi>Origen</hi> plainly aſſerts.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100327:15"/> 
                     <hi>If this ſaying, [I will give thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven] be common to the rest; why ſhall not likewiſe all thoſe things be common to all, both which are ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and which follow after, as ſpoken to PETER</hi> 
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">Tract. 1. in Matth. 16.</note>? Of the ſame Judgment muſt all thoſe Fathers before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd be, who were of Opinion, that the other Apoſtles had the ſame Faith, and would have made the ſame Confeſſion, had not <hi>Peter</hi> prevented them. For ſince they knew, that this Article of our Faith could not be known, but by Divine Revelation; they muſt of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity hold, that all they that knew it had ſuch a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of it. To which I may alſo add, All thoſe who affirm that the Promiſe of the Keys was made not only to <hi>Peter,</hi> but to all the Apoſtles, which (as I ſhall afterward ſhew) was the general Opinion of the Fathers.</p>
                  <p>I might here fairly diſmiſs the Diſcuſſor, for his Foundation failing, whatſoever is built upon it muſt of it ſelf tumble down. And were indeed both his Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions true: Were it true, that the other <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were ignorant of Chriſt's Divinity, and that <hi>Peter</hi> attained to the knowledg of it by a particular Revelation; yet he muſt be a Man of rare Art, who can ſuperſtruct his Supremacy upon ſuch a bottom. For what connection is there between theſe two Propoſitions, <hi>Peter</hi> firſt knew the Divinity of Chriſt by ſpecial Revelation, therefore <hi>Peter</hi> hath ſupreme Juriſdiction over the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church? Is not this Conſequence altogether as good, <hi>Andrew</hi> knew him to be the Meſſiah before <hi>Peter,</hi> therefore <hi>Andrew</hi> was <hi>Peter</hi>'s Superior? And this is ſomewhat better, St. <hi>John</hi> lay in Chriſt's Boſom, or had the uppermoſt place next after Chriſt at Meals, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>John</hi> is the Prince of the Apoſtles? Are not theſe admirable Conſequences? And yet I fear we ſhall find no better proofs for <hi>Peter</hi>'s Supremacy.</p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:100327:15"/>
                  <p> But becauſe ſome perhaps may ſay, It is not much material whether theſe Hypotheſes ſtand or fall, ſince the direct Proofs he afterwards produces, both from Scripture and the Antients, are a Foundation that can never be ſhaken; I ſhall proceed to examine the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his Diſcourſe, though not in his prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Method. It is an abſurd thing to talk of the Pope's Supremacy, as St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Heir, unleſs St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy be firſt made out; I ſhall therefore begin with that, and in caſe it appear, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was inveſted with this paramount Power, it will then be fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether it deſcended to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> as his Heir.</p>
                  <p>The Proofs he produces of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Supremacy are (as I ſaid before) no other than thoſe two Texts of Scripture, commonly preſs'd by the Romaniſts to ſerve in this cauſe, and the Sayings of ſome Fathers to confirm the ſenſe he gives of theſe Texts. In the firſt of theſe <hi>(viz. Matth.</hi> 16. 18, 19.) he fancies he is furniſhed with a double Argument; one from theſe Words, <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock will I build my Church:</hi> The other from theſe Words, <hi>And to thee will I give the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> ver. 19.</p>

But though he cites the Fathers to no Purpoſe, it may not be impertinent to note two things from thoſe here cited.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He quotes, <hi>Tertul. Lib. contra Marc.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 103.</note> as if it were but one ſingle Book; whereas <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath written five Books againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> each of them conſiſting of a great Number of Chapters. As exact is he in the Words cited. <hi>Tertullian</hi> enquiring the reaſon, why <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Name was changed to <hi>Peter,</hi> his Words are theſe; <hi>Sed &amp; cur Petrum? Si ob vigorem fidei, multae materiae ſolidaeque nomen de ſuo accomodarent. An quia &amp; Petra et lapis Chriſtus? Siquidem et legimus poſitum eum in lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem offendiculi et in Petram ſcandali; omitto caetera. Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que adfectavit cariſſimo Diſcipulorum de figuris ſuis peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ariter nomen communicare</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Adverſ. Marc. l. 4. c. 13.</note>. Which he thus recites: <hi>Chriſtus Petrum ita vocat, quia lapis &amp; Petra ipſe eſt, ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que affectavit cariſſimo diſcipulorum de figuris ſuis peculia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riter nomen communicare.</hi> But I preſume he took it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on truſt, and therefore may be excuſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Three of the four Fathers he quotes, give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this name, and the reaſon given by two of thoſe three, is as applicable to the other Apoſtles, as to <hi>Peter.</hi> So is that of St. <hi>Auſtin, Conſortium meretur nominis, qui conſortium meretur et operis.</hi> And ſo is that of St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, Recte quia Petra Chriſtus, Simon nuncupatus eſt Petrus, ut qui cum Domino fidei ſocietatem habeat, cum Domino habeat et nominis Dominici ſocietatem.</hi> Now ſince the reaſon they give of it, is common to them all, we may hence reaſonably conclude, that they thought this <hi>illuſtrious Title,</hi> as truly applicable to the other <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> as to St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:100327:17"/>
                  <p> But one thing I may not omit, leſt the <hi>Diſcuſſor</hi> ſhould think it unanſwerable. Upon a Quotation out of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> Hom. 28. <hi>de Poenit.</hi> to ſhew, that <hi>Peter</hi>'s being the Rock, doth not exclude Chriſt from being ſo, he makes this Remark. <hi>'Tis very obſervable here, that this Father acknowledges Chriſt, to have made the other Apoſtles LIGHTS, SHEEP, and PRIESTS; but he mentions but ONE ROCK, WHICH IS PETER</hi>

                  <p> But St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> declares them <hi>Wretched, and Hereticks that diſown him to be the Rock:</hi> Thus <hi>Agon.

                  <p n="2">2. If it be granted; yet the Succeſſion of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Biſhops, cannot by Virtue of theſe Words, be the <hi>ſole Rock,</hi> or any more the <hi>Rock,</hi> than the Succeſſion of Biſhops in any other Apoſtolical Church.

                  <p>(1.) That St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> here uſes the very ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> that <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian,</hi> and ſeveral other Fathers had uſed before, againſt the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks of their times, to prove the Catholick Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> The Succeſſion of Biſhops in the Apoſtolical Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <note n="†" place="margin">Iren. l. 3. c. 3. &amp; l. 4. c. 63.

                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p>Though I cannot foreſee any advantage he can take againſt Proteſtants from this Conceſſion; yet when he ſays, <hi>That to affirm the Church to be built on</hi> Peter<hi>'s Faith, is not to bar or diſclude his Perſon, but to ſignify the CA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE why it was ſuperedified on him</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 110.</note>: Since I have already proved, that the ſame Faith was common to them all, it plainly follows, for the ſame cauſe, that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100327:20"/> the Church was built upon them all, and not upon <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> only. And the meaning of thoſe Fathers, who choſe rather to affirm, the Church to be built upon St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Faith or Confeſſion, than upon his Perſon, was not <hi>to aſſign the REASON, why our Saviour made choice of him above the reſt, to build his Church upon</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Tho.

                  <p>Though all his Quotations are here impertinent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is ſo, for the proof of which they are brought; yet becauſe there may be ſome ſuch Words or Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ſome of them, as ſhew theſe Fathers were of Opinion, not only that the Church was built upon <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Perſon (which is that, for which he alledges them) but (as the Diſcuſſor may pretend) infer their Belief of his Supremacy, I ſhall therefore examine thoſe which make the faireſt ſhew this way; which are one Paſſage of <hi>Theophylact,</hi> another of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s, and thoſe Titles which ſome of them give to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>I proceed to the ſixth Chapter, where (if any where) we have reaſon to expect ſomething to the purpoſe: His Deſign here is to ſhew S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Preeminence, as he is the Foundation of the Church above the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. And yet,</p>
                  <p>1. He grants, that all the Apoſtles <hi>in reference to their Apoſtolick Power, had equal Authority of founding Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in any part of the World; in Relation to their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, were equally Orthodox and Infallible:</hi> As to <hi>what concerned their Writings, they were alike Canonical; and what appertained to the Government of all other Chriſtians, they were equally PASTORS, HEADS, and RECTORS</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 118.</note>. This is a large Conceſſion; if in <hi>what appertained to the Government of all other Chriſtians, they were EQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY PASTORS, HEADS &amp; RECTORS;</hi> then one would think, <hi>Peter</hi> had not a more <hi>univerſal Paſtorſhip</hi> than they. But we Hereticks are, it ſeems, miſtaken; For <hi>notwithſtanding they were all equal Foundations in theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, St. PETER was here the only ſole Rock, on which</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt promiſed to build his Church:</hi> the <hi>only</hi> and the <hi>ſole Rock</hi> too. But in caſe he were <hi>here</hi> the <hi>ſole Rock,</hi> if <hi>elſewhere</hi> the other <hi>Apoſtles</hi> are <hi>Rocks</hi> too, what Preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence doth this give him above them? But perhaps he did not intend to lay any Streſs upon the word <hi>here:</hi> Well then, they were <hi>equally Foundations,</hi> but St. <hi>Peter</hi> was the <hi>only Rock;</hi> that is to ſay, every one of them was a <hi>Rock</hi> as much as he; and yet none of them was a <hi>Rock</hi> but he. Not ſo; for they were <hi>equally Foundations,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>all other Chriſtians,</hi> whereas <hi>Peter</hi> was the <hi>ſole Rock of the Church.</hi> Were not then <hi>all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> the Church? not the whole, but only part of it;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100327:22"/> 
                     <hi>for the Church did conſiſt, NOT ONLY OF ALL CHRIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIANS WHATSOEVER, B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T EVEN OF THE APO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STLES THEMSELVES:</hi> Then the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> it ſeems, were no <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſince beſides <hi>all Chriſtians whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> the Church conſiſted of the <hi>Apoſtles too;</hi> that is, it conſiſted of ſuch as were <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and ſuch as were <hi>no Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It will be ſaid, by <hi>all Chriſtians whatſoever,</hi> he means no more, than all <hi>other</hi> Chriſtians whatſoever, beſides the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Be it ſo; the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> then were built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Peter,</hi> but all other <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> upon <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> jointly. But how could the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> be built upon <hi>Peter,</hi> ſeeing they were built (were both Diſciples of Chriſt, and Apoſtles) before this Promiſe was made to <hi>Peter,</hi> whereas nothing was built on him, but what was to be built after it.</p>
                  <p>He adds, <hi>If they (viz.</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles) were Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they were ſub Petro, et poſt Petrum.</hi> If they were Foundations <hi>ſub Petro,</hi> then <hi>Peter</hi> was built upon them: let it be therefore <hi>poſt Petrum, whom our Saviour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, choſe out of the Apoſtolick College, and with his own Hands, laid NEXT TO HIMSELF</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 118</note>. <hi>Chriſt</hi> then as the Foundation of all (even of <hi>Peter</hi> too) is laid firſt, <hi>Peter</hi> is laid next to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the other <hi>Apoſtles</hi> are laid upon <hi>Peter,</hi> and one upon another in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective order; let us ſuppoſe, in the order, in which they are mentioned by St. <hi>Matthew, Andrew</hi> is laid next to <hi>Peter, James</hi> next to <hi>Andrew, John</hi> next to <hi>James:</hi> Now in this order, as <hi>Peter</hi> is the Foundation of the other eleven Apoſtles, ſo <hi>Andrew</hi> is the Foundation of ten, which are laid upon him, <hi>James</hi> is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of nine; and ſo at laſt, <hi>Peter</hi>'s being the <hi>ſole Rock</hi> upon which the Church was built, amounts to no more than this, that one Stone more was laid upon <hi>Peter</hi> than
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100327:23"/> upon <hi>Andrew,</hi> and two more upon <hi>Peter,</hi> than upon <hi>James.</hi> Again; <hi>If the meaning of the Churches being built on</hi> Peter <hi>and his Succeſſors, is, that he and they are ſupreme Heads of the Church</hi> 
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">Pag. 131.</note>. Then the univerſal Church, all ſave <hi>Peter,</hi> being built upon <hi>Andrew, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> was ſupreme Head of all, ſave <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf: And all except <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi> being built upon <hi>James; James</hi> was ſupreme Head of all, except <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo the Church had as many ſupreme Heads as there were Apoſtles. And is this at length all that Excellency of Power they aſcribe to St. <hi>Peter?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reaſons he gives, why Chriſt made <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>only Rock</hi> are, 1. <hi>Becauſe he did HERE engage himſelf by Promiſe ſolely to him, to build his Church on him, upon his peculiar Confeſſion of his Divinity, which the Apoſtles till they had learnt it of him, were ignorant of.</hi> The Foundations of which reaſon have been already razed. 2. That <hi>what our Saviour repli'd to his Confeſſion</hi> (to paſs over thoſe Elegancies <hi>viciſſim</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>was reciprocally directed to him only (the Pronouns Tu and Tibi excluding Plurality and Partnerſhip) not only as an Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, but as a Reward.</hi> From the Pronowns <hi>Tu</hi> and <hi>Tibi,</hi> no more can be inferred, than that he in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar was entituled to theſe Promiſes; not that the other <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were excluded; nor is there one word to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them in thoſe ſayings of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and St. <hi>Cyril</hi> he afterward quotes to this Purpoſe. It is one thing to ſay, Chriſt <hi>here</hi> promiſed <hi>Peter only</hi> to build his Church upon him; another thing to ſay, Chriſt <hi>here</hi> promiſed <hi>Peter,</hi> that he would build his Church on <hi>him only,</hi> and no other. Though the Promiſe was <hi>here</hi> directed to <hi>Peter</hi> only, yet nothing is more manifeſt, than that what is <hi>here</hi> promiſed, was afterward conferr'd upon the other Apoſtles. Inſtances of a like nature frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occur in the Holy Scripture.</p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:100327:23"/>
                  <p> But what if this Gentleman preſently contradicts himſelf, and yields, that <hi>Peter</hi> is not the <hi>only Rock?</hi> This he certainly does, if he grants there are other <hi>Rocks</hi> beſide him; and he muſt of neceſſity grant this, when he ſays, God <hi>did deſtine him to be in a more peculiar excelling manner the THE ROCK, on whom he would build his Church</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 121.</note>. For could he be <hi>the Rock, in a more excelling manner,</hi> unleſs there were other Rocks whom he excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? Thus after his bold Advance, he cowardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats: The <hi>ſole Rock,</hi> is now put the <hi>more excelling Rock;</hi> Chriſt promiſed to build his Church not on him <hi>only,</hi> but on him <hi>more eminently,</hi> or on him <hi>in a more ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and remarkable manner;</hi> as he alſo expreſſes it <note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 119, &amp; 123.</note>.</p>
                  <p>And in this Dr. <hi>Tho. G.</hi> concurs with the Diſcuſſor. For having before given St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Paraphraſe upon the Words, he adds, <hi>By which it appears that our Saviour, when he gave to</hi> SIMON <hi>the Name of</hi> PETER, <hi>that is, a ROCK, made him the Rock on which he would build his Church, and that in a more eminent manner, than any other of the Apoſtles.</hi> 
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">
                        <hi>Sermon of St.</hi> Peter, p. 23.</note>. By the way, if he made him the <hi>Rock,</hi> when he gave him the Name of <hi>Peter,</hi> then he made him ſo before, and by conſequence not at the ſame time when he ſaid to him, <hi>Thou art Peter, &amp;c.</hi> as the Doctor affirms in the Page immediately foregoing; for it is certain he gave him that Name before; <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 16. <hi>John</hi> 1. 42. But let us ſee what their proofs are, I fear we ſhall find nothing of the ſolidity of the <hi>Rock</hi> in them.</p>
                  <p>1. The Doctor ſays, That this <hi>is every where affirm'd by the ſame holy Doctor</hi> (St. <hi>Jerom) giving him the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of PRINCE, CHIEF, HEAD, and GREATEST OF THE APOSTLES.</hi> I grant, that St. <hi>Jerom</hi> gives him theſe Titles; but abſolutely deny, that he meant thereby that Chriſt built his Church <hi>more eminently</hi> upon him, that is (as he interprets it) gave him a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100327:24"/> Preeminence of Power over the other <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> The Reaſons of my denial are theſe; 1. Becauſe in that very place where he ſays <hi>Peter</hi> was conſtituted the <hi>Head,</hi> he alſo ſays, <hi>What is ſaid of Peter</hi> (Matth. 16. 17, 18.) <hi>is in another Text affirm'd of them all, and that the ſtrength of the Church is eſtabliſh'd upon them EQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ALLY</hi>

Becauſe St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains his meaning, when he calls him the <hi>Prince of the Apoſtles,</hi> as to exclude all pretence to Authority over them.

                  <p n="1">1. We have here a Foundation of <hi>Straw</hi> or <hi>Hay.</hi> A new ſort of Foundation for <hi>a Houſe,</hi> which he has not borrowed from his Maſter <hi>Bellarmin;</hi> let him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have the honour of the Invention.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. How can this be the Reaſon why the <hi>Sees</hi> of the other Apoſtles <hi>have been detriumph'd,</hi> ſeeing they were not only founded ſeverally upon their reſpective <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> but all of them jointly upon <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf? For tho the other Apoſtles were Foundations with reſpect to other Chriſtians; yet they were but the Superſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture (as he would have it) with reſpect to St. <hi>Peter</hi> who was the <hi>Rock</hi> upon which the Apoſtles themſelves were built, and by conſequence all the Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that were built upon them.</p>
                  <p>But it may perhaps be ſaid, Tho <hi>Peter</hi> was indeed a <hi>Rock,</hi> yet a Foundation of <hi>Straw</hi> being laid upon him, this intermediate Foundation failing, the Superſtructure muſt fall too. True. But may we not as wiſely argue, Though Chriſt was indeed a Rock, yet <hi>Peter</hi> was but a Foundation of <hi>Straw,</hi> laid upon him the <hi>primary Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> ſince his <hi>See</hi> hath been ſo often <hi>detriumph'd, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Pollutions of undermining Hereſy;</hi> witneſs Pope <hi>Liberius, Honorius,</hi> and other <hi>Heretical Popes.</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:100327:27"/> And therefore if what he next aſſerts be true, I ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the contrary, but <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf may be as <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanid a Foundation</hi> as any of his Fellow-Apoſtles. For,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Peter,</hi> he ſays, <hi>ſignifies ſuch a Foundation as is fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon an inexpugnable Rock. Peter</hi> then is not now <hi>the Rock</hi> it ſelf, but only a Foundation fixed upon it. And why may not a Foundation of <hi>Wood</hi> be ſo? And yet,</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the next words <hi>Peter</hi> is again <hi>tranſubſtantiated</hi> into a <hi>Rock,</hi> and <hi>ſuch a Rock as is not only able to repel the foaming Surges of the aſpiring Sea, but can walk on the back of its towering Waves</hi>

We do not impute this to <hi>Chance,</hi> or to the <hi>Will</hi> of the Writer, but ſuppoſe there was a ſpecial Reaſon for it; but this Reaſon we ſay, was his <hi>Primacy of Order,</hi> not any <hi>Superiority of Power</hi> over the reſt of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> He is <hi>Primus</hi> who hath the firſt place in any Society, and for that Reaſon is <hi>expreſly</hi> ſo call'd, and put in the <hi>Head of the Catalogue,</hi> as the Doctor very well knows. And this place St. <hi>Peter</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd while our Saviour lived on Earth, but after his Aſcenſion to Heaven, <hi>James</hi> the Brother of our Lord was ſet above him: For he (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> and St. <hi>Jerom</hi> tell us, <note n="‖" place="margin">Euſeb.

The like order was obſerved in the Synod of the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> For as it was the Cuſtom in ſuch Aſſemblies, for him that was firſt, to ſpeak laſt; ſo we accordingly find, that <hi>James</hi> as Preſident of that Council ſpake laſt, ſumm'd up all that <hi>Peter</hi> had ſaid before him, and gave the final Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>It is an Argument that the Fathers aſcribed no ſuch Authority to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in that what he produces from them for the Proof of it is nothing to the purpoſe; as will appear by the recital of it. <hi>When St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſays of himſelf,</hi> Gal. 1. 18. <hi>that he went to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſee PETER, St. AMBROSE, (or the Author of the Commentaries,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>gives this reaſon of it; becauſe he was PRIM<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S INTER APOSTOLOS, C<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>I DELE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GAVERAT SALVATOR C<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RAM ECCLESIAR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M,</hi> The FIRST AMONG THE APOSTLES TO WHOM

                  <p>I ſhall conclude this with the words of two late Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion.

                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ellies Du Pin Diſſert. Hiſt. 4. p. 311.</note>. And again; <hi>The Queſtion, whether</hi> Peter <hi>had the FIRST PLACE among the Apoſtles is Hiſtorical, and may be proved by the Teſtimony of Writers, both of the ſame, and of following Ages</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Diſſert. 4. S. 2. p. 313.</note>. <hi>They ſay alſo,</hi> ſays another <hi>Romanist, that he is ſometimes nam'd the first, but if it had been always ſo, this would not prove, that he had Authority over the others,</hi>

                     <hi>as the Pope aſſumes it over Biſhops: Among the Preſidents a Mortier the firſt hath no Power over the other; nor amongst the Electors of the Empire; the Elector of</hi> Mentz <hi>who hath the firſt place, hath not any Authority over the other Electors, and ſo in every Society, the Primacy does not carry Dominion with it</hi>

                  <p>But though it doth not appear by what the Doctor hath alledged, That the Apoſtles after the coming down of the Holy Ghoſt, underſtood Chriſt's words in the Roman Senſe; yet by many other Paſſages in the New Teſtament it is obvious, that neither St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or the other Apoſtles had any ſuch ſenſe of them. For if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had, would he have affirm'd, That <hi>he was in nothing behind the very chiefeſt Apoſtle</hi>

                  <p>4. He next produces the <hi>Sayings of ſome Fathers, to prove the Church more eminently built upon</hi> Peter, <hi>than on any of the other Apoſtles</hi>

                        <hi>St.</hi> Peter<hi>'s Supremacy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 123.</note>. Such Sayings, he imagins, as may <hi>be a ſufficient Collyrium to open our cieled Eyes, and fetch off thoſe Scales, which have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed our viſive Faculty</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 125.</note>. Tho we make not the <hi>Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Fathers,</hi> but the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> the Rule of our Faith; and if in this, or any other point, we ſhould
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100327:31"/> refuſe to ſtand to their Judgment, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> cannot blame us, without condemning themſelves, ſince no Men pay leſs reſpect to the Fathers than they, when they find themſelves pinch'd with their Authority; yet ſo far are we from declining their Judgment, in this, or any other matter in diſpute, between us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that we confidently appeal to them.</p>
                  <p>The firſt he produces is St. <hi>Jerom, who on</hi> Iſa. 2. <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving compared them (viz.</hi> the Apoſtles) <hi>to Mountains, ſays, Super unum montium Chriſtus fundat Eccleſiam, et loquitur ad eum, dicens, Tues Petrus, et ſuper hanc Petram,</hi> &amp;c. that is, upon one of the Mountains Chriſt founds his Church, and ſpeaks to him, ſaying, <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock I will build my Church.</hi> That Chriſt <hi>founded</hi> his Church on <hi>Peter,</hi> is not the thing to be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that he <hi>more eminently founded</hi> it on him, than on any other Apoſtle. He will ſay perhaps, this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd; How ſo? Becauſe in ſaying, <hi>Christ founded his Church upon one of the Mountains,</hi> he implicitly excludes all the reſt. If ſo, then he excludes all the reſt, not from being <hi>more eminently,</hi> but from being <hi>ſimply</hi> Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; whereas he himſelf grants, they were all <hi>Foundations,</hi> in ſaying <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>more eminently</hi> ſo. But whoſoever ſhall impartially read the Context, he will conclude it was far from St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s meaning, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the other Apoſtles from what he here attributes to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> for but ſix lines before, he ſays, <hi>This Houſe (viz.</hi> the Church) <hi>is built upon the Foundation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Prophets, who alſo themſelves are Mountains, as Imitators of Chriſt</hi>

But why then does he here ſay, that Chriſt founds his Church <hi>upon one of them?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, the plain reaſon is this, Theſe Words being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to <hi>Peter</hi> alone, and none other, St. <hi>Jerom</hi> was of Opinion, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>this place,</hi> made him alone the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100327:31"/> Foundation of the Church, but that <hi>elſewhere</hi> he made all the Apoſtles Foundations equally with him. This he as expreſly and plainly aſſerts as Words can do it, in the place before-quoted out of his firſt Book againſt <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinian,</hi> c. 27.</p>
                  <p>But what follows, <hi>must needs confound all the Enemies of St.</hi> Peter <hi>and his Succeſſors, but ſuch as have their face caſed in triple Braſs</hi>

                  <p>But what is this which muſt of neceſſity confound us? That <hi>St.</hi> Jerom, <hi>beſides his owning him to be the Rock, he calls his Cathedra at</hi> Rome <hi>likewiſe ſo, in his Epiſtle to</hi> Damaſus; <hi>Ego Beatitudini tuae, id eſt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>Cathedrae Petri communione conſocior, ſuper illam Petram aedificatam Eccleſiam ſcio.</hi> I can perceive nothing in this Teſtimony ſo confounding, as to need a <hi>Caſe of triple Braſs</hi> to fence us againſt it.

                  <p n="1">1.

And as he believed that Hereſy had got into the Chair formerly, ſo he thought it not impoſſible, but it might do ſo again; yea, that even <hi>Damaſus</hi> himſelf might fall into the Arian Perfidiouſneſs; elſe why does he in this ſame Epiſtle ſo earneſtly deprecate it? <note n="*" place="margin">Jungatur cum Beatitudine Urſicinus, cum Ambroſio ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Auxentius.

                  <p>To reconcile St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> to himſelf, a learned Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt gives us this account, why in one place, he ſaith the Church is founded upon <hi>one,</hi> and in another place upon <hi>many: Cyprian,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in the first Expoſition,</hi>

                  <p>But to clear up St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s meaning, I ſhall ſpeak a little more diſtinctly: His Senſe in this matter, may I think be compriſed in theſe Propoſitions, which I ſhall now barely mention, and if occaſion require it, ſhall hereafter fully confirm.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That our Saviour when he ſpake theſe Words, <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock will I build my Church,</hi> promiſed to <hi>Peter</hi> alone, and no other, that the Church ſhould be founded on him. Hence it is, that he ſays, <hi>the Church is built upon one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whatſoever in theſe Words he promiſed to <hi>Peter,</hi> he afterwards conferr'd the ſame, and in the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100327:34"/> upon the other Apoſtles. Hence it is, that he makes them <hi>all equal in Honour and Power with</hi> Peter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That he promiſed this at firſt to <hi>Peter alone,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend that Unity he deſigned to have in his Church, and to make him the Pattern of it; ſo far was he from thinking of any Power over the reſt here promiſed to <hi>Peter,</hi> that he never ſo much as intimates it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the Unity he made him the Pattern of, was not that of the univerſal, but of particular Churches; he promiſed to build his Church upon <hi>one,</hi> to ſhew that in every particular Church he would have but <hi>one,</hi> that ſhould be the Principle of Unity, the Foundation upon which all the reſt ſhould depend.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That the Biſhops as Succeſſors of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> are this Principle of Unity, and the Foundation, every one in his own Church, upon which all the reſt depend. It never entred into his Thoughts, that any one Biſhop, was to be the Principle of Unity to all other Biſhops and Churches in the World. Nor did <hi>Stephen</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in his Conteſts with <hi>Cyprian,</hi> ever pretend this; which doubtleſs he would have done, had any ſuch Prerogative been then claim'd by <hi>Stephen,</hi> or grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Cyprian;</hi> ſince this, without any more ado, muſt have brought <hi>Cyprian</hi> to a Submiſſion to him. And therefore,</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He ſuppoſed theſe Words, <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Rock,</hi> &amp;c. were as applicable to all Biſhops, as they were to St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf; and accordingly they are by him ſo apyly'd, and the Rights of all particular Biſhops eſtabliſhed upon them; ſo far was he from find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them any peculiar Prerogative of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> And what is there now of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in all this? or of the Churches being built <hi>more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently</hi> upon him, than upon the other Apoſtles? Not ſo much as one word that looks that way.</p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:100327:34"/>
                  <p> I preſume he quotes the next words out of <hi>Cyprian, Navigare audent &amp; ad Petri Cathedrane, atque ad Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am principalem, unde <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitas Sacerdotalis exorta eſt;</hi> for theſe two reaſons: (1.) Becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is here called the <hi>principal Church.</hi> (2.) Becauſe Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Unity is ſaid to ariſe from thence. But neither of theſe are to his purpoſe. Not the firſt, it being called the <hi>principal Church,</hi> becauſe it was conſtituted in the principal City; as <hi>Rigaltius</hi> notes upon the Words, and quotes the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Canon of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> to confirm it <note n="†" place="margin">In urbe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipali conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam.

                     </note>. Not the ſecond, becauſe by <hi>Priestly <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> he means no more than the Preſidency of <hi>one</hi> Biſhop in <hi>one</hi> City, which he ſays is derived from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe that was the See of <hi>Peter,</hi> who was the Pattern of this Unity. And by this he aggravates the crime of <hi>Feliciſſimus</hi> and his Complices, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſet up another Biſhop at <hi>Carthage</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Cyprian,</hi> durſt make their Appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> which was the example of Epiſcopal Unity to other Churches <note n="‖" place="margin">

                  <p>Nothing can be imagined more directly contrary to that <hi>Papal Supremacy</hi> he contends for, than this very Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> out of which this Paſſage is taken; in which the good Father moſt ſeverely condemns Appeals to <hi>Rome;</hi> aſſerts that every one's Cauſe ought to be heard where the Fault is committed, that to every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor a portion of the Flock is aſſign'd, which he rules and governs, as one that is to give an Account to God alone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it may be preſumed the learned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man knows nothing of this, nor ever ſaw any more of the Epiſtle than theſe two lines, which he found quoted by ſome other Author, as wiſe as himſelf. Had he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed the whole Epiſtle, he would not have dared to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100327:35"/> quote one word out of it, leſt the Reader by examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, ſhould take occaſion to read all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>His next Teſtimony from <hi>Greg. Nazienzen</hi> ſays, <hi>That of all the Diſciples of Chriſt,</hi> Peter <hi>is called the</hi> Rock, <hi>and intrusted with the Foundations of the Church</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 125.</note>. Which hath been already more than ſufficiently anſwer'd. Had he look'd back no further than the Oration immediately foregoing <note n="†" place="margin">Orat. 25.</note>, he might have ſeen, That this Father aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to every Apoſtle his particular Province, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently on St. <hi>Peter;</hi> and by conſequence did not ſuppoſe that the Church was built <hi>more eminently</hi> upon him than the reſt.</p>

However the place he refers to is, I ſuppoſe, in his 2<hi>d</hi> book, where ſpeaking of <hi>Peter</hi> he hath theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">

If the Reader pleaſe to compare the words cited by the Diſcuſſor, with thoſe in St. <hi>Basil,</hi> he will further ſee that he is not wont to conſult the Authors he quotes.</p>
                  <p>And now at laſt, that I may, if poſſible, oblige the Diſcuſſor, I will grant, what he has not prov'd; that in ſome reſpect it may be truly ſaid, <hi>the Church is built more eminently on St.</hi> Peter.

               <p>I Think I have ſaid enough to ſatisfy every impartial conſidering Reader, that St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Supremacy</hi> is not founded upon <hi>this Rock,</hi> and therefore muſt fall to the Ground, unleſs ſome other Foundation be found to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it.

               <p>Now the whole of their Diſcourſe from hence, that is pertinent to the preſent Queſtion, may be reduc'd to theſe four Propoſitions</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this Promiſe of the <hi>Keys</hi> was made to <hi>Peter</hi> alone.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That he alone <hi>immediately</hi> receiv'd them, and the other Apoſtles <hi>derivatively</hi> from him.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That the Power of the <hi>Keys</hi> communicated to the other Apoſtles, was inferior and ſubordinate to a higher Degree of it in St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. That by the <hi>Keys</hi> thus promiſed to and received by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> is meant the ſupreme Power of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the Church.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Suppoſe the Reply addreſſed to <hi>Peter only,</hi> and the Promiſe <hi>here</hi> made to <hi>him alone;</hi> doth it hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that Chriſt intended to give the thing promiſed to none elſe? Had Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> to <hi>thee only</hi> will I give the Keys, this would have followed; but it no way follows, from Chriſt's ſaying only to him, I will give thee the Keys. From the Promiſe made to him in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular it only follows, that he in particular ſhould have them; not that none others ſhould have them beſides him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>But that which follows next is moſt admirable; <hi>that whatſoever was meant by either of thoſe Texts, they being ſpoken conjointly to the twelve,</hi> Peter <hi>had certainly as large a ſhare in them as any</hi> (he need not fear, but he is ſo far in the right) <hi>but having (over and above his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this joint Promiſe) a particular one apart to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in which the reſt were immediately no Sharers, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſproved, (but by virtue of this ſingular ſeparate Promiſe made to him perſonally in the Preſence of the reſt) that he had the Keys either alone, or if the Power of the Keys was afterwards given to the reſt, that he was ſupreme in it.</hi> If by <hi>this particular,</hi> this <hi>ſingular Promiſe,</hi> this <hi>Promiſe made to him perſonally,</hi> he mean a Promiſe of any particular or ſingular Power, beſides that which was promiſed to the reſt, he ſuppoſes that which he ſhould firſt have proved, and which I have already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed: If he means that Promiſe made to <hi>Peter particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly</hi> and <hi>ſingly,</hi> which was afterwards made to all the Apoſtles, at what an abſurd rate does he talk? A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made to twelve jointly; the very ſame Promiſe, neither more nor leſs, was before made to one of theſe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100327:39"/> twelve apart; therefore this one, hath either himſelf alone, that which is promiſed to all the twelve; or if the reſt have it, he hath it in a higher Degree than they: Or thus; If a Promiſe be firſt made to one Man ſingly, and the ſame Promiſe be afterwards made to this one and many more together; the making the Promiſe to him firſt ſingly, either excludes all the reſt from any ſhare in it, or gives him a greater ſhare in it than they. For inſtance; the King promiſes to A in particular, to give him a Captains place, he afterwards promiſes the ſame Preferment to A, B, C, D, E, F, together; A, becauſe the Promiſe was firſt made to him alone, muſt either alone be made Captain, and B, C, D, E, F, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; or if B, C, D, E, F, be made Captains, A, becauſe it was <hi>first</hi> promiſed to him, muſt be made their Colonel or General. Theſe are good Conſequences by the Diſcuſſor's Logick; and therefore he ſpae more Truth than perhaps he was aware of, when he ſaid, that <hi>Diſputation was an Employment, not only diſcordant to his Temper, but ſurmounting his Abilities.</hi> I have ſaid enough to ruin the firſt Propoſition.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond is this, that Peter received the Keys im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from Chriſt, but the other Apoſtles from or by him; <hi>Peter</hi> ſays he, <hi>did not receive them, ſo as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them ſolely to himſelf, but to communicate them to the other Apoſtles</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 162.</note>. And again; <hi>they then may be ſaid to receive the Keys ſecondarily, derivatively, participatively, by their aſſociating, adhering, and communicating with him their Head</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Ibid.</note>. The Falſeneſs of which is ſo manifeſt, that one would think none but a Man who had never read the New Teſtament, could have the Face to offer it
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100327:39"/> to thoſe that have; for can any thing be more evident than that theſe words, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall bind on Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. were ſpoken by Chriſt himſelf <hi>immediately,</hi> to all the Apoſtles? And when that Power was actually conferr'd, that was here promiſed, was it <hi>Peter</hi> or Chriſt that ſaid to them, <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Whoſe Sins ye remit, they are remitted; and whoſe Sins ye retain, they are retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> Was it not Chriſt that ſaid to them immediately, <hi>Go into all the World, and preach the Goſpel to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi> But inſtead of multiplying Proofs from Scripture, I ſhall rather ſend him to his Maſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> whom in this Point he deſerts. That the Apoſtles received their Juriſdiction <hi>immediately</hi> from <hi>Christ,</hi> and not from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> he proves by four Arguments: <q>
                        <hi>1ſt.</hi> By thoſe Words of Chriſt, <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you.</hi> Which place, ſays he, the Fathers, <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Theophylact,</hi> ſo expound, that they plainly ſay, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were made by theſe words, the Vicars of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> yea, that they received the very Office and Authority of <hi>Chriſt. 2dly.</hi> By the choice of <hi>Matthias</hi> into the place of the <hi>Traitor Judas:</hi> For we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. that <hi>Matthias</hi> was not choſen an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but his Election being begg'd and obtain'd from God, he was numbred among the Apoſtles. But ſurely if all the Apoſtles had their Juriſdiction from <hi>Peter,</hi> that ought moſt eſpecially to have been ſhewn in <hi>Matthias. 3dly.</hi> It is proved from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who profeſſedly teaches, that he had his Authority and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and thence proves himſelf to be a true Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. And that he might ſhew that he received not his Authority from <hi>Peter</hi> or the other Apoſtles, he ſaith, <hi>When it pleaſed him who ſeparated me from my Mother's Womb, and call'd me by his Grace to</hi>

But that the Apoſtles had Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, is manifeſt by the Acts of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. excommunicates; and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 7, 11, 13. and frequently elſewhere makes Laws; and alſo becauſe the Apoſtolical Dignity, is the firſt and ſupreme Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Church, as is manifeſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Had our Saviour been of the Diſcuſſor's Mind, he would have ſpoken to this Effect, <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I thee</hi> Peter; <hi>and as I ſend thee, ſo do thou ſend them.

                  <p>Secondly, If we conſult the Fathers, we may obſerve in them thoſe two things pertinent to our Purpoſe. 1. Not one of them intimates, that any thing was to be found in this Text peculiar to <hi>Peter,</hi> by which he was ſet above his Brethren; but whatſoever Power was here given, they ſuppoſed it given in common and equally to them all.

The Power here given to all the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> they take to be ſo full, that a fuller and more ample could not be given to <hi>Peter.</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſays, <hi>He gave them all Heavenly Power, when he ſaid to them, Whoſe Sins ye remit, they are remitted,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And what Power can be greater than this?

                  <p> But notwithſtanding all that hath been ſaid to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Fathers, if we may take the Diſcuſſor's Word, are plainly on his ſide; and if we will not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit his Word, he has produc'd their own Words, to aſſure us that they are ſo.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore examin the Teſtimonies produc'd, having firſt premiſed theſe two things as preparatory thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>But granting his Argument to be nothing, yet <hi>it is evident from hence,</hi> ſays the Diſcuſſor, <hi>that</hi> Origen <hi>did believe</hi> Peter <hi>to be more eminent, and to ſurmount the reſt in the Power of the Keys</hi>

                  <p>But the Truth is, this place of <hi>Origen</hi> is nothing to the Purpoſe. For he doth not here compare <hi>Peter</hi> to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100327:45"/> the reſt of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> (to whom he ſuppoſed the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Keys was equally given, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.) but to thoſe private Chriſtians only, who ſhould thrice admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their offending Brother; he ſuppoſing the Words <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 18. to be directed to thoſe alone, who told their Brother of his fault; as will be evident to every one who ſhall impartially conſider the place.</p>
                  <p>The next Father he quotes is St. <hi>Hilary.</hi> And how does it appear, that he gives a larger Portion of the Keys to <hi>Peter,</hi> than to the other <hi>Apoſtles?</hi> Thus, that whereas he calls the other Apoſtles, <hi>Janitores Coeli, the Door-Keepers of Heaven;</hi> he calls <hi>Peter by way of Tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, O Beatus Coeli Janitor, O bleſſed Door-Keeper of Heaven.</hi> Is not this Demonſtration? It might paſs for ſuch with the Diſcuſſor, had not St. <hi>Hilary</hi> in another place unluckily given the ſame Title (and another too as high) to all the <hi>Apoſtles: You</hi> O HOLY AND BLESSED MEN, <hi>who for the merit of your Faith have obtained the</hi> KEYS OF THE KINGDOM OF HEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEN, &amp;c. <note n="*" place="margin">Vos, O ſancti et beati viri, ob fidei veſtrae meritum claves regni Coeloruin ſortiti, et ligandi atque ſolvendi in Coelo et in terra jus adepti. de Trinitat. l. 6.

But that which I obſerve is, That inſtead of <hi>Locum,</hi> St. <hi>Hilary</hi> hath <hi>Gloriam.</hi> Now ſince he was of opinion (though different from all that went before him) that <hi>Peter alone</hi> at that time knew the Divinity of <hi>Christ</hi> by a ſpecial Revelation from God; what can he mean by this <hi>ſupereminent Glory,</hi> but that he obtained the honor of confeſſing Chriſt's Divinity, while the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were as yet ignorant of it?</p>
                  <p>But it is <hi>obſervable, that whereas he affirms the other Apoſtles to have received the Keys of Fidei ſuae meritum, he aſſerts in his Comments on</hi> Matth. 13. <hi>Petrum fide cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teros anteiſſe.</hi> From whence he infers, <hi>That he having a greater portion of Faith, conſequently had a larger power of the Keys.</hi> But nothing can be more evident, than that <hi>Hilary</hi> does not mean by <hi>anteiſſe,</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> had a <hi>greater Portion</hi> of Faith than the reſt, but that his Faith was before theirs <hi>in time;</hi> the words immediately following, being theſe, <hi>For the reſt not knowing it, he firſt anſwered, Thou art the Son of the living God</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Nam ignorantibus caeteris, primus reſpondit, Tu es Filius Dei Vivi. Comment. in Matth. Can. 14.</note>. But is it the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that a Biſhop hath the power of the Keys more or leſs in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the meaſure of his Faith? If ſo, then ſuppoſing <hi>Peter</hi> had a Supremacy of Power, the Pope cannot ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him therein, unleſs he ſucceed him alſo in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100327:46"/> of his Faith: And I fear the <hi>Diſcuſſor</hi> will be hardly put to it, to name any one Pope, whoſe Faith hath ſurmounted that of all other Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>The five next Teſtimonies, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> (though no ſuch words as thoſe he quotes are in <hi>Serm.</hi> 66.) <hi>Cyril, Baſil, Chryſoſtom, Cyprian,</hi> are all imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, becauſe they only affirm ſimply, that the Keys were given or entruſted to <hi>Peter.</hi> So <hi>Ambroſe, He it is that received the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> So <hi>Cyril, Peter bearing the Keys of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. There is nothing of compariſon in any of theſe Quotations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apoſtles; nothing to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, that he hath the Keys in a higher degree than they. If any thing be hence inferr'd, it muſt be this, That <hi>Peter</hi> had the Keys <hi>ſolely,</hi> becauſe they ſeem to ſpeak excluſively of the other Apoſtles. But that this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be their meaning, the Diſcuſſor himſelf grants <note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 158, 159, 161, 162.</note>. That they cannot mean, that he had this Power in a higher degree than the other Apoſtles, is as evident; becauſe the very ſame Fathers make him and the reſt <hi>equal</hi> in this Power. What then is the reaſon why they ſpeak after this manner? Either, 1. Becauſe theſe words, <hi>I will give thee the Keys,</hi> were directed to <hi>Peter alone,</hi> tho meant to all the Apoſtles (as St. <hi>Ambroſe.)</hi> Or, 2.

                  <p>That <hi>Bede</hi> cannot mean by the Words he quotes, that <hi>Peter</hi> had any Degree of Power above the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, is manifeſt, in that he expreſly attributes to them all, the very ſame Power of binding and looſing, that was given to <hi>Peter.

All therefore that he means by the Keys being given to <hi>Peter prae caeteris,</hi> is this, that they were given to <hi>Peter</hi> firſt, and to the other Apoſtles after his Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>He acknowledges, St. <hi>Auſtin affirms, the Keys to be given to the Church when they were given to St.</hi> Peter <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 165.</note>.

Not if rightly underſtood,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for if you conſult his Writings, you will find the reaſon which moved him to affirm this, was becauſe</hi> Peter <hi>repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Church; now in what Quality he repreſented it, he diſcovers himſelf in his Tract. ult. in Johan.

He did bear the Perſon of the Church, <hi>propter A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolatus ſui primatum, propter primatum quem in Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulis habuit,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolatus principatum tenens;</hi> that is, by reaſon of the Primacy of order, or Precedence he had among the Apoſtles; for this is the Primacy St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> means, as appears by his own Words, in the place quoted by the Diſcuſſor himſelf, in the next Page;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100327:47"/> ſuch a Primacy, from which not the leaſt <hi>ray</hi> of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty can be derived. This, he ſuppoſes was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why our Saviour made choice of him to repreſent the Church, rather than another. But to ſay he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Church in the Quality of its Prince or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, is non-ſence: A Prince, as ſuch, cannot repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent his Subjects; nor any Governor, thoſe under his Government. Beſides, that theſe very places of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> he produces, are a direct Contradiction to this Conceit, as may appear by a ſhort Reflection upon them. The firſt, with the addition of thoſe Words he hath omitted, as not for his turn, is thus in Engliſh; <hi>Of which Church</hi> PETER <hi>for the Primacy of his Apoſtleſhip did bear the Perſon, the whole being figured in him. For as to what properly appertains to him, he was by Nature one Man, by Grace one Chriſtian, by more abundant Grace, one and the firſt Apoſtle.

                     <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 134.</note>. But were theſe Keys in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Had he abſolute power of raiſing the Dead? No, he will ſay he doth not quote it to this purpoſe, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſhew that the Keys in this place ſignify <hi>abſolute Dominion</hi> over that which is ſpoken of. Suppoſe they do ſo here, what then? Do the Keys ſignify as much when attributed to <hi>Peter,</hi> as when attributed to Chriſt? Is there no difference between the <hi>Keys</hi> in the Hands of the Maſter of the Family, and in the hands of his Steward. A twofold difference at leaſt muſt be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end, one in the Quality, the other in the extent of the Power denoted by them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the Quality; The <hi>Keys</hi> in the Maſter's Hands denote an Original, Abſolute, Supreme Power; in the Steward's, a Power delegated and ſubordinate to that of the Maſter. Thus the <hi>Keys</hi> in Chriſt's Hands ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy Supreme Power; but if when given to <hi>Peter,</hi> they denote the ſame Supremacy, then there muſt be two <hi>Supreme Powers</hi> over the ſame Family, which is a plain Contradiction. Yea, ſince (as I have proved) the <hi>ſame Keys</hi> were afterwards promiſed to, and conferred upon all the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> if they ever denote <hi>Supremacy of Power,</hi> there muſt be as many <hi>Supremes</hi> as there were <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the Extent of the Power; the Maſter's Keys extend to the whole Family (be it never ſo large) the Stewards, to that part of the Family only over which
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100327:50"/> he is ſet: Thus for inſtance, the <hi>Lord high Steward</hi> of the King's Houſhold, his Power is limited; he hath no Authority over the Officers of his Majeſty's Chappel, of his Chamber, of his Stable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the whole Church in Heaven and Earth is Chriſt's Family; that part of it in Heaven, the <hi>Diſcuſſor,</hi> I think, will not affirm, that it is ſubjected to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but to Chriſt immediately: That part on Earth is ſubdivided into particular Churches, as ſo many leſſer Families, over which Chriſt hath appointed there ſhall be ſo many Stewards, one Steward over one part, another over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

St. <hi>Paul</hi> and all the reſt of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were <hi>Stewards</hi> in this Family, as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> or elſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> was out in his reckoning, when he ſaid to the <hi>Corinthians, Let a Man ſo account of us, as of the Miniſters of CHRIST, and STEWARDS of the Myſteries of God</hi>

For though he grants, that the other Apoſtles had <hi>moſt full and ample Power to found Churches every where, to convert, baptize, and preach to every Creature; yet notwithſtanding all this, they did not equalize</hi> Peter—For he <hi>by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of theſe our Saviour's Words was created, not only chief Paſtor of all other Chriſtians, but even of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves.</hi> Which becauſe he here only aſſerts, but afterward pretends largely to prove, I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remit the Conſideration of it to another place.</p>

But it is eaſier to repeat an Aſſertion, than to anſwer the Arguments by which it is confirm'd. But ſee how the <hi>Diſcuſſor</hi> proves it to be a Commiſſion. <hi>The Words,</hi> ſays he, <hi>being pronounced by a Lord to his Servant, impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, have no Lineaments of an Exhortation, but of a Commiſſion</hi> 
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">Ibid.</note>. Is then every Command of a Lord to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100327:52"/> his Servant a Commiſſion? A Commiſſion, I thought had ever conveyed ſome Power, which the Perſon had not, before he received that Commiſſion. But a Lord may I hope command his Servant to do that which he had before impower'd him to do. If this be all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to a Commiſſion, moſt of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are <hi>Commiſſions,</hi> for as they are expreſſed in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative Form; ſo (if the Romaniſts ſay true) he was ſo great a Lord, that not only thoſe to whom he direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Epiſtles, but the Apoſtles themſelves were his Servants. But I need not inſiſt upon this, ſince Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> himſelf hath ſo fully anſwered it. <hi>His fourth Argument,</hi> ſaith the Doctor, is, <hi>that Paſce being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed imperatively, and ſpoken by a Lord to his Servant, ought in all reaſon to ſignify a Command; ſince then every Command of a lawful Superior gives a Commiſſion to do that which he commands, and the Words expreſſing this Command are in a particular manner ſpoken to</hi> Peter, <hi>it follows, that St.</hi> Peter <hi>had by them a particular Commiſſion given him to feed Chriſt's Flock.</hi> To which the Doctor anſwers by denying, <hi>that every Command of a lawful Superior gives a Commiſſion; for it is,</hi> ſays he, <hi>evident, lawful Superiors may command to exerciſe their Commiſſion, after it is given. Is not this viſible in the Field every Day? The General gives his Commiſſion, firſt for the raiſing of an Army, then in any particular Expedition, he gives out Commands, an hundred perhaps in a Day, and is there any Colour of Probability for each of theſe Commands, that it ſhould be the giving a Commiſſion? If there be, it muſt be founded in the Equivocalneſs of the word Commiſſion, ſo as not only the Conveying the Power and Authority, or Office ſhall be meant by it (which is the ordinary Notion) but the giving out any Order</hi>

I fear he will be hard put to it, to ſhew what Power was here given to <hi>Peter,</hi> above what he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for he was before impower'd to <hi>feed Chriſt's Sheep:</hi> Yea, I have already proved, not only by the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Fathers, but of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Maldonat,</hi> that no greater Power could be contained in theſe Words, <hi>Feed my Sheep,</hi> than was before conveyed to him, and the reſt of the Apoſtles; by thoſe other Words, <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you,</hi> &amp;c. The neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which is, that they could not contain a Commiſſion properly ſo call'd. However, if every Command of a Maſter to a Servant to do his Duty, muſt be a Commiſſion, I then grant that this is ſo.</p>
                  <p>But he finds the Fathers looking upon theſe Words, as a <hi>Command, Commiſſion, Injunction,</hi> (he ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds Command and Commiſſion) <hi>as a great Truſt committed to him:</hi> No greater, than what they believed was before committed to him. But St. <hi>Bernard calls it in plain Terms a Commiſſion.</hi> I might tell him that St. <hi>Bernard</hi> uſes the Word in a looſe improper Senſe, but I need not, becauſe St. <hi>Bernard</hi> is too much a Child to be reckoned for; or rather too much the Pope's Slave, to be of any Authority in this matter. But now ſuppoſe the Fathers were all of Opinion, that theſe Words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Commiſſion properly ſo called, yet the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſor</hi> will get nothing by it, becauſe their joynt Opinion was, that what was here ſaid to <hi>Peter</hi> appertain'd in common to all the Apoſtles; and in as high a Degree to them, as it did to him.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Reaſon he gives, why <hi>Peter</hi> was ſorry, ſeems to me as <hi>pleaſant and divertive,</hi> as the Reaſon his Antagoniſt gave, why it was an Exhortation, ſeem'd to him. <hi>I muſt tell you,</hi> (magiſterially enough for a new Convert) <hi>he had little reaſon to be chearly.</hi> Why?
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100327:53"/> 
                     <hi>For Chriſt had no ſooner given him his Commiſſion, but he allay'd his Joy, by foretelling him his Cruciſixion.</hi> He was grieved before he foretold this, and therefore had no Joy to be allay'd.

If ſo, the Fathers were miſtaken in expreſſing their ſenſe; for that this is not the ſenſe of thoſe Sayings he cites from them, will appear by a ſhort review of the Particulars, which I ſhall now give you. <hi>After his Tears,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Ambroſe, he is taken to be a Paſtor, and receives others to be govern'd by him, who had not before govern'd himſelf</hi>

                  <p>In all that confuſed heap we have in the Remainder of theſe two Chapters, there is nothing needs an Anſwer, but that alone which is the main thing in Debate, <hi>viz. That</hi> Peter <hi>as ſupreme Paſtor had Authority of feeding the univerſal Church, including both the Apoſtles and other Chriſtians</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 187, 194.</note>. This he attempts to prove by two Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the Text it ſelf, which he pretends are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſenſe of the Fathers: The firſt from the Queſtion, <hi>Loveſt thou me more than theſe?</hi> The ſecond from the Injunction, <hi>Feed MY SHEEP.</hi> The Vanity of his Attempt will ſoon appear.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>If Chriſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>had deſigned him to be no more a Paſtor than any of the reſt, the Queſtion had been more rationally ſtated thus,</hi> Simon Jona, <hi>do you love me AS M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CH as any of the other do? but our Savior asking him, whether he loved him more than the reſt, did by the Shape and Frame of the Queſtion intend him a particular Superiority above the reſt</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 190, 191.</note>. To the ſame purpoſe Dr. <hi>Tho. G.</hi> ſays, <hi>to take away all Suſpicion, as if he meant not to give him an Authority above that of the reſt of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, he asked him not only if he loved him, but if he did not love him MORE THAN THEY; manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring by the Exceſs of Love he required from him, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable EXCESS or Superiority in the Power that he committed to him</hi> 
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">Pag. 30.</note>. <hi>This,</hi> adds the Diſcuſſor, <hi>ſeems to me moſt ſerenely to be the native and genuine meaning of of our Saviour's Queſtion, diſarray'd of all Heretical Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> (rarely elegant!) <hi>otherwiſe I deſire to know to what Purpoſe and Deſignment was the Interrogation of a greater Degree of Love.</hi> I will be ſo kind, as to tell him <hi>most ſerenely,</hi> what is the <hi>native</hi> and <hi>genuine</hi> Reaſon of this.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100327:56"/> The Interrogation is of a <hi>greater degree of Love,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to that Profeſſion <hi>Peter</hi> had formerly made, <hi>tho all ſhould be offended becauſe of thee, yet will I never be offended</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 26. 33.</note>. Where <hi>Peter</hi> having profeſſed a Love to Chriſt above all the reſt, and yet when he was put upon the Trial, having failed more than any of them, by thrice denying him; our Saviour therefore puts the Queſtion compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, <hi>Loveſt thou me more than theſe?</hi> Art thou ſtill as confident as thou waſt heretofore, that thou haſt a greater Love for me than theſe have? To which he now returns a more modeſt Anſwer, profeſſing only the Sincerity of his Love, but making no Compariſon with others, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt I love thee:</hi> As much as to ſay, I have now learnt by ſad Experience, not to prefer my ſelf before others, I will not therefore ſay, that I love thee more than any of my fellow-Diſciples, but I dare appeal to thy ſelf who knoweſt the Heart, for the Truth of my Love; <hi>thou, Lord, that knoweſt all things, knoweſt that I love thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore that <hi>Peter</hi> loved Chriſt more than any of the other Apoſtles, (though it were certain that he did ſo) cannot be concluded from this Queſtion, much leſs, <hi>that this his egregious Love was the Motive that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd Chriſt to grant him this Commiſſion,</hi> (as the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſor words it;) and leſs yet, <hi>that Chriſt by commanding him to feed his Sheep, did declare him to be the greateſt Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> Nor can it hence be inferr'd, as Dr. <hi>Tho. G.</hi> would have it, that <hi>Chriſt required an Exceſs of Love from him:</hi> The feeding of his Sheep being enjoyn'd, as an Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his <hi>Love only,</hi> and not of his <hi>greater Love.</hi> If thou loveſt me as thou profeſſeſt, give proof of thy Love to me by feeding my Sheep.</p>
                  <p>There is therefore no need to determine, whether <hi>Peter</hi>'s Love ſurpaſſed that of all the other Apoſtles,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100327:56"/> ſince all that is here upon the Profeſſion of his Love re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him, or (if the <hi>Diſcuſſor</hi> will have it ſo) the Commiſſion here given him, does no way exceed that given to the other Apoſtles; ſo that ſuppoſing him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch a <hi>raging, ardent, mad Lover of Chriſt</hi> (as the <hi>Diſcuſſor</hi> very handſomly renders St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s words) and that this Love was the Ground of the Truſt here committed to him, it cannot hence with any colour of Reaſon be inferr'd, that he was advanc'd to any the leaſt Superiority over them. And therefore all the Quotations of the Fathers to prove either of theſe, are loſt Labour; and I may paſs over the two next Pages as impertinent, except one Paſſage which deſerves an <hi>Aſterisk,</hi> (had we not met with ſomething like it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) That <hi>according to the Proportion and Meaſure of his Love, was the Extenſion and Latitude of his Power</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 192.</note>. If the Pope's Power have the ſame meaſure, to what a narrow Compaſs will it be reduc'd? For if we may judge their Love, by what their own Writers tell us of the Fruits of it, in many of their Lives, there is no honeſt Curate who will not be admitted, not only to be an <hi>equal Sharer,</hi> but to be his <hi>Superior</hi> in this Paſtoral Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond Argument is taken from the Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Feed MY SHEEP.

                     <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 29, 30.</note>. The Diſcuſſor hath offer'd two Arguments why <hi>Oves meas</hi> muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100327:57"/> in this latitude. (1.) Becauſe the words are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd indefinitely. (2.)

Could any unprejudic'd Perſon have ever ſo much as dream'd, that by <hi>Feed my Sheep</hi> Chriſt meant, be thou Lord over all thy fellow-Apoſtles? But let us conſider the Reaſons he gives.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>the words are deliver'd indefinitely, in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited manner, there being no exception, reſtriction or diſtinction</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 194, 195.</note>. In anſwer to which it will be ſufficient to ask this Gentleman a few Queſtions.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Whether every <hi>indefinite</hi> Expreſſion be to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>univerſally.</hi> For inſtance, when <hi>Christ</hi> ſaid to <hi>Peter, Thou ſhalt henceforth catch Men,</hi> whether it was meant ſimply and without exception, all the Men in the World? Who does not know that an indefinite Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is equivalent ſometimes to an Univerſal, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to a Particular? That when its parts are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily connected, it is equivalent to a Particular only? But he thinks to defend himſelf by the great Name of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> who ſays, <hi>That which is indefinite comprehends all.</hi> St. <hi>Baſil</hi> was too great a Maſter of Reaſon, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert that which every Freſh-man in Logick knows to be falſe and abſurd; ſo that if theſe are his words, it is certain he meant not every Indefinite, but an Indefinite ſo qualified.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Whether <hi>all Nations,</hi> and <hi>every Creature</hi> be not words of as large extent as <hi>my Sheep?</hi> Or whether the two former (being expreſly univerſal) do not extend to more than the later? And if ſo, whether every <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had not at leaſt as large a Commiſſion as this here given to <hi>Peter?</hi> And conſequently, whether this Argument be not as good as that of the Diſcuſſor? <hi>Andrew</hi> had a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100327:57"/> Commiſſion to <hi>go into all the World, and to preach the Goſpel to every Creature;</hi> but <hi>every Creature</hi> includes the <hi>Apoſtles, Peter</hi> himſelf not excepted; therefore the other Apoſtles, not excepting <hi>Peter,</hi> were St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Sheep.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Whether the <hi>Flock of God</hi> be not as indefinite as <hi>my Sheep?</hi> Whether it doth not comprehend both <hi>Lambs</hi> and <hi>Sheep</hi> too? And if ſo, whether when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts the Elders of <hi>Epheſus, to feed the Flock of God,</hi> he gives not every one of them Commiſſion to feed the Apoſtles, and among them <hi>Peter,</hi> as well as the reſt?</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) If all Chriſt's Sheep without exception be here committed to <hi>Peter,</hi> whether <hi>Peter</hi> be not committed to his own Government; and by conſequence whether he be not both ſuperior and inferior to himſelf; his own Prince and Subject too? Since he grants that <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is one of <hi>Christ's</hi> Sheep.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) Whether the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were not under the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Conduct of the Holy Ghoſt? And if ſo, whether it be reaſonable to ſuppoſe, they were ſubject to the Conduct of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> And to add but one more,</p>
                  <p n="6">(6.) Whether St. <hi>Paul</hi> (for inſtance) was St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Curate? The Diſcuſſor will do well to anſwer theſe, and ſeveral other ſuch like Queſtions which may be put to him, before he ventures to publiſh his ſecond Book.</p>

                  <p>He now haſtens <hi>to conclude,</hi> but before he comes to it, he thinks fit to ſhew the Proteſtant Divine, <hi>how fair an Antagoniſt he has of him.</hi> To that end he thus beſpeaks him: <hi>If you can prove, that the other Apoſtles were none of Chriſt's Sheep, I will exempt them from</hi> Peter<hi>'s Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecture</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 199, 200.</note>. He need not prove this, to procure their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption, unleſs the <hi>Diſcuſſor</hi> firſt prove that every <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite</hi> is equivalent to a <hi>

                     <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> But <hi>Christ often calls them Sheep,</hi> and <hi>this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces him to believe that he meant them.</hi> When <hi>Christ</hi> calls them ſo, he calls <hi>Peter</hi> ſo too, and this will then enforce him to believe, that he meant <hi>Peter</hi> as much as the reſt. But the Truth is, by <hi>Oves meas</hi> he meant neither him, nor the other <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who as they are <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> are never reckoned as <hi>Sheep,</hi> but as <hi>Shepherds,</hi> and therefore not to be fed themſelves by any, but all of them to feed others. Now that I may not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind-hand with him in Kindneſs, but may ſhew my ſelf as <hi>fair an Antagonist,</hi> as he is, I will make him the like offer, by which he will perceive how concluding his Argument is.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100327:60"/> Is there any thing in the Context, that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines it to the Apoſtles?

                  <p n="1">1. Not one of them atteſts, that the whole Flock was recommended to him, as will appear by a recital of them. St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſays, <hi>As a good Shepherd he received the Flock;</hi> that <hi>he was that faithful and wiſe Servant, whom the Lord ſet over his Family; that by the Judgment of the Lord the Flock was committed to him.</hi> St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi> ſays, <hi>the Flock was by Chriſt entruſted to him.</hi> And <hi>Epiphanius, that he was entruſted with the Flock.</hi> St. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil</hi> calls him <hi>a Shepherd after Chriſt.</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> again ſays, <hi>That he excelled the reſt of the Apoſtles.</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobius, <hi>That none of the Apoſtles but</hi> Peter, <hi>had the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Paſtor from our Saviour.</hi> Where is it ſaid, that the <hi>whole</hi> Flock, or that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were recommended to him? But I ſhall not paſs over theſe without a few Remarks.</p>
                  <p>(1.) That the firſt paſſage he gives us from St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> is not to be found in the <hi>47th</hi> Sermon out of which he quotes it; perhaps his memory here failed him, for he before cites a Sermon of St. <hi>Auſtin's</hi> for the very ſame words. But that I rather obſerve is this, that in the other Paſſage, immediately after the Words he quotes concerning <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſays all the ſame things, and more of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which he frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently conceals.</p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:100327:61"/>
                  <p> (2.) Whereas St. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſays only, Chriſt <hi>conſtituted</hi> Peter <hi>a Paſtor of his Church AFTER himſelf:</hi> He tells us St. <hi>Baſil</hi> calls him, <hi>the Shepherd NEXT after Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(3.) His abuſe of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom in Inſcript. Act. Apoſt.</hi> is ſuch, as equally betrays both his Folly and Inſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He ſays <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> calls <hi>Peter the Head Paſtor of the Apoſtles.</hi> But now if he was their <hi>Head-Paſtor,</hi> he was not their <hi>ſole Paſtor,</hi> they muſt have another <hi>Paſtor</hi> over them, ſubordinate to <hi>Peter;</hi> this ſhews his Folly. (2.) Nor is the Inſincerity leſs egregious: For that which <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſays is this; <hi>that</hi> Antioch <hi>received the first of the Apoſtles as its Paſtor, (Peter</hi> having been Biſhop there) His Words are thus engliſhed. <hi>This is one Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of our City, that in the Beginning it received the chief of the Apoſtles for its Teacher.

The truth is, the Title it ſelf is no where given by our Saviour to <hi>Peter;</hi> he commands him indeed to feed his Flock, but if this be to give him the Title of <hi>Paſtor,</hi> the ſame Title is given, not only by St. <hi>Paul</hi>

Though this hath been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently clear'd already, in that they thought there was nothing contained in thoſe Words, <hi>feed my Sheep,</hi> that was peculiar to St. <hi>Peter;</hi> but what was applicable in common, not only to all the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but to all <hi>Biſhops</hi> that ſucceeded them; yet I ſhall plainly prove it from the Context of two of thoſe very places, which the Diſcuſſor hath alledged for the Proof of the contrary; <hi>viz.</hi> the one that of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> the other that of St. <hi>Baſil.</hi>

                  <p>What follows next, is a high Encomium of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> from whoſe perſonal Excellencies, I have no Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to detract; though I ſee no reaſon to advance him to the debaſing of all the reſt. Let him be, if he pleaſe, <hi>the most reſplendent amongst the Apoſtles, the most reful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of the holy Dozen;</hi> yet to ſay, that <hi>therefore he was culled out of that illuſtrious Society, by the diſcerning Eye of Christ, as the fittest Perſon among them to be his Vicar,</hi> (as if he made him alone his Vicar) betrays ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquaintance, not only with the holy Scriptures, but with the Writings of the Ancients, as one would not expect from ſo great a Pretender to Antiquity. Chriſt made all the Apoſtles his Vicars, when he gave them that Commiſſion, <hi>John</hi> 20. 21, 22, 23. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> reckoned himſelf, and the other Apoſtles his <hi>Vicars,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>We are Ambaſſadors for Christ; We beſeech you in CHRIST'S STEAD</hi>

Hiſt. de Script. Eccl. tom. 1. p. 440. Sixt. Senenſ. Bibl. S. l. 4. p. 247.</note>. But having conſulted three Editions of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> I can find no ſuch words, nor any like them, in the Comment upon that Chapter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> he tells us, affirms, that our Saviour was pleaſed at his departure out of this World, to entruſt the care of his Sheep to <hi>Peter,</hi> as <hi>a faithful and vigilant Guardian, and not only to him, but to his</hi> SUCCESSORS AFTER HIM. But by his <hi>Succeſſors</hi> he cannot mean the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> only, for as he ſays nothing of them in the words before or after, ſo he includes himſelf in the number of theſe Succeſſors, though he was yet no Biſhop, but a Prieſt only. And if the reaſon why Chriſt intruſted his Sheep to <hi>Peter,</hi> was becauſe he found him <hi>a faithful and vigilant Guardian;</hi> as he had the ſame reaſon to intruſt them to the other <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ſo for the contrary reaſon, few <hi>Popes</hi> have been found for a thouſand years, to whom he would have intruſted them.</p>
                  <p>I have now examined the Texts of <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Greek and Latin Fathers</hi> alledged by the Diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor for the proof of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Supremacy:</hi> And upon a review of the whole, I think every unbiaſs'd Reader will conclude with me, 1. That his Proofs from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are not ſo full, but he might have been content to have taken to their aſſiſtance, thoſe other Scripture-proofs produc'd to this purpoſe by ſome of their learned Men; ſuch as, <hi>Chriſt paid Tribute only for himſelf and</hi> Peter; Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>alone caſt himſelf into the Sea;</hi> Peter <hi>drew the Net to the ſhore full of great Fiſhes; Chriſt ſaid to</hi> Peter, <hi>SI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON SLEEPEST THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>?</hi> 2. That he hath not <hi>ſteered his Courſe by the unerring Pharo's of Antiquity</hi> (as he promiſed <note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 3.</note>) but by new Lights, which have led
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100327:64"/> him quite contrary to that Courſe the Antients ſteered.</p>
                  <p>No place therefore is left for the ſecond Inquiry, <hi>viz. Whether the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>ſucceeded PETER in this Supremacy?</hi> ſince <hi>Peter</hi> can be ſucceeded by none, in that which he never had. Should it indeed be granted, that <hi>Peter</hi> was inveſted with it, it will not follow, that the <hi>Pope</hi> has it, unleſs it be proved, firſt that <hi>Peter</hi> was in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> and 2. That all the Power <hi>Peter</hi> was inveſted with, was to deſcend to his <hi>Roman</hi> Succeſſors; neither of which will be ever proved. But now if <hi>Peter</hi> was never poſſeſs'd of ſuch Supremacy himſelf; admit he was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that whatſoever Power he had, was derived to his <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Succeſſors, no ſuch Supremacy could be derived from him to them. It would be therefore an idle thing to inſiſt upon this, eſpecially conſidering, that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſor himſelf hath not done ſo, but ſpoken of it only occaſionally, and out of place; intending, I preſume, to make this the main Subject of his ſecond Book (which he has promiſed). But if he reſolve to be as good as his word, and to oblige us with another of his Books, let him firſt eſtabliſh <hi>Peter</hi>'s Supremacy upon a more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Foundation than he has yet done, otherwiſe he will but render himſelf the more ridiculous, in endeavouring to erect the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Supremacy upon it.</p>
